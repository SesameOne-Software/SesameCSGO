# WeCheat
WeCheat dev repo (2018/Legacy cheat)

Originally created late 2018 to be the best free cheat, right before the new year during the start of desync. Project lasted for several years but was usually unstable and incomplete. Here it is, in its final form, highly optimised, and decently stable. I will no longer be working on this project. This project contains some "interesting" and questionable programming practices. This software is NOT trust-factor safe, I javent really touched it for 2.5 years. PRs still are welcome.

This software was downgraded for 2018/Legacy HVH, but - I can create a separate branch to add the latest desync version.
